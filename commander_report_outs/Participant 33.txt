	•	Controls: [ Straight-forward, Somewhat difficult, very difficult] 

Questions: 

	•	1. Was there any type of strategy you used as you were playing the game? Wanted to make sure I got through every door. Because I saw tricks in the training mission. Not every door would be a door, so I had to figure out how to get around. 
	•	[Prioritization Strategy] (yellow-first) Yellow boxes and then once they died I went with green
	•	[Navigation Stratgy] (Wing-by-wing, rm-by-rm, save all as found; Stick to the plan, what made you change your plan, if anything) at first it was room by room. I didn’t realize there were wings. First one on the left. I didnt remember a middle one or even a right. I realized it wasn’t a great strategy and focused on a wing by wing strategy
	•	[Plan Dynamics] Change your plan?
	•	When?
	•	[Deliberate vs vs Opportunistic] Followed a plan or saved victims as soon as you saw them?
	•	2. How did you remember where every victim was in the mission space? I don’t know how I remembered. I remembered what the room looked like and the general location where they were. 
	•	[Marking Strategy] Used a strategy to remember victim locations?
	•	Any things you used in the environment to remember where you had been?
	•	3.  Do you remember any times where you went into a room more than was needed. Yea one room in the left room (hallway to the hallway). There was one room without anyone in it
	•	When did that happen? Towards the end
	•	[Efficiency, Use of Attention] How often did you do this? (Not at all, A few times, More than a few times, A lot)  Just happened the one time
	•	4. Do you have a vivid mental picture of the map of the building? Yes
	•	If yes, please describe? Green entryway. Then a fork with rooms outside of it. Three wings and rooms and rooms on the side of these. Windows at the end
	•	[Mental Mapping] Degree of accurate recollection? Excellent
	•	Any rooms you missed?
	•	5. Did you feel any type of pressure as you were completing the mission? (time, confusion, Minecraft controls, frustration, notifications) Yes, 
	•	If so, what type? Time pressure and reading the instructions added pressure
	•	When? For yellow boxes I felt pressure. Once yellows perished, there’s nothing I could do now. Still high because I still wanted to get the green victims
	•	How frequently? 
	•	6. Were there any emotions that you experienced throughout the mission? First red I was disappointed because I didn’t see that remaining fork
	•	[Emotions] If so, what type?
	•	When? 30 seconds remaining before yellow box victims
	•	How frequently?  Just once
	•	7. Noticed my warning before yellow box victims expired? Yea
	•	Thoughts on reminder? It was a good reminder
	•	Useful? Useful because you told me when they would perish was helpful
	•	Did you change your behavior as a result of my warning? I was already in the zone. But that added some pressure because it was less time than expected. Renewed urgency
	•	Earlier, later, just right? If it came at the beginning of the mission, that would be most helpful. Not sure if it would change my behaviors. 
	•	Evoke any feelings?

	•	Glitches & Bugs:
	•	Intermittent lag, nothing else 
	•	Suggestions for improvement:
	•	I pressed a button when I didnt do anything. 
	•	Reminders to turn on lights and ignore distractions
	•	Save time by running (reminders to run)
