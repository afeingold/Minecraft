	•	[Navigation Stratgy] (Wing-by-wing, rm-by-rm, save all as found; Stick to the plan, what made you change your plan, if anything) 
	•	[Plan Dynamics] Change your plan? Yea the things I mentioned earlier. Once right click worked it was yellow first. I rezlized the space was smaller than expected, 
	•	When?
	•	[Deliberate vs vs Opportunistic] Followed a plan or saved victims as soon as you saw them?
	•	2. How did you remember where every victim was in the mission space? I didn’t really. Since the main hallways were simplistic, I thought about it wing by wing.

	•	When did that happen? Yea it happened a lot. Was confused and needed to compensate for short term memory issues.

	•	When?
	•	How frequently? Very strong in first 7 minutes. Tapered off after notice. I felt pressure w/green ~200 seconds and find all of the green 
	•	6. Were there any emotions that you experienced throughout the mission? Mild disappointment because I didn’t get as many yellows as I’d had hoped
	•	[Emotions] If so, what type?
	•	When?
	•	How frequently?

	•	Earlier, later, just right?

	•	Glitches & Bugs:
	•	Right click for a short period. Had to reconnect. Yellow victims expired early on first run. Had to run again
	•	Suggestions for improvement:
	•	Map intervention
	•	Playing pc games because of familiarity--would repeat with a controller 
	•	Nice if rooms have numbers, but I’m bad at remembering the rooms. Color or some wallpaper
	•	Giving a map to tag or auto-tag the door. For me, I was using the doors to familiarize myself if there were green blocks left
