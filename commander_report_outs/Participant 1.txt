Post-task review questions/guide for data collection

Template
Strategies used, Other Observations:
	•	Prioritization strategy (Yellow-first) In general, I saved the yellow box victims. I had the expectation to see everything first to look at each room. I tried keeping track of no of victims at first and where, but it was a lot of work
	•	Navigation Planning (Wing-by-wing, rm-by-rm, save all as found; Stick to the plan, what made you change your plan, if anything)  Room by room and checked every wing left to right. That evolved slightly when I saw my first blocked room. I was checking if there was a room there. 
	•	Deliberate vs ad-hoc Navigation (mixed Strategy), use of Attention Deliberate strategy. Somewhere in the middle. Mostly deliberate, but sometimes it changed. I realized the rooms and space was symmetrical. Way more like a maze than I expected
	•	Marking Strategy (external marks in world, mental cues) Mine was doors being open vs. closed. And that gave me confidence I’ve already been there vs. not
	•	Efficiency (re-trace steps, needlessly re-visit rooms) I visited each room twice. Once high priority, then once for leftover. Finally, checked all rooms to see if I missed anyone. Room 203 had door closed, but didn’t realize I had already visited. 
	•	Coverage (Double-check sweeps)
	•	Mental mapping skill/memory Yea I used it and occassionally play games like this. So it was helpful
	•	Affected by pressures (time, confusion, Minecraft controls, frustration, notifications)  Yes, time was the one that gave me the most pressure. The visible timer helped me plan my timing. One issue I had was lag (5 out of 10). Walking around was easy
	•	Emotions (anxious/stressed, sad about missing a victim, excited, happy to save victims) Uncertainty, not being sure to complete the task. Also optimistic that it was doable. At the 480 second timer. I was uncertain at ~530 seconds, but was still worried I missed someone. Then the notification made me feel relaxed. Frustrated how long it took to find the green blocks. 
	•	Noticed my warning before yellow block victims expired? yes
	•	Thoughts on reminder? Didn’t impact me because that was my plan anyways. Slightly annoyed because you’re telling me something I already knew
	•	Useful? Not really
	•	Earlier, later, just right? Just right. Gives player enough time. Actually it’s too late, not enough time left. 
	•	Evoke any feelings? Slight annoyance.
