I had the expectation to see everything first to look at each room. I tried keeping track of no of victims at first and where; but it was a lot of work,	•	Navigation Planning (Wing-by-wing; rm-by-rm; save all as found; Stick to the plan; what made you change your plan; if anything)  Room by room and checked every wing left to right. That evolved slightly when I saw my first blocked room. I was checking if there was a room there. ,	•	Deliberate vs ad-hoc Navigation (mixed Strategy); use of Attention Deliberate strategy. Somewhere in the middle. Mostly deliberate; but sometimes it changed. I realized the rooms and space was symmetrical. Way more like a maze than I expected,	•	Marking Strategy (external marks in world; mental cues) Mine was doors being open vs. closed. And that gave me confidence I’ve already been there vs. not,	•	Efficiency (re-trace steps; needlessly re-visit rooms) I visited each room twice. Once high priority; then once for leftover. Finally; checked all rooms to see if I missed anyone. Room 203 had door closed; but didn’t realize I had already visited. ,	•	Coverage (Double-check sweeps),	•	Mental mapping skill/memory Yea I used it and occassionally play games like this. So it was helpful,	•	Affected by pressures (time; confusion; Minecraft controls; frustration; notifications)  Yes; time was the one that gave me the most pressure. The visible timer helped me plan my timing. One issue I had was lag (5 out of 10). Walking around was easy,	•	Emotions (anxious/stressed; sad about missing a victim; excited; happy to save victims) Uncertainty; not being sure to complete the task. Also optimistic that it was doable. At the 480 second timer. I was uncertain at ~530 seconds; but was still worried I missed someone. Then the notification made me feel relaxed. Frustrated how long it took to find the green blocks. ,	•	Noticed my warning before yellow block victims expired, yes,	•	Thoughts on reminder, Didn’t impact me because that was my plan anyways. Slightly annoyed because you’re telling me something I already knew,	•	Useful, Not really,	•	Earlier; later; just right, Just right. Gives player enough time. Actually it’s too late; not enough time left. ,	•	Evoke any feelings, Slight annoyance. ,,Participant: _1____  date: _4/22/2020____ (e.g; 4-11-2020); time:__14:56_____ (e.g; 12:15am-11am),	•	Pilot Experiment Goal / Focus:,	•	,	•	World file version: v2.05.01-Training CMU,	•	Finished time: ____mins; saved all (y/n); red blocks/deaths, ; score: _365___,	•	Impression ,	•	Difficulty:  	 [ Extremely Hard; Very Difficult; Moderate; Easy; Trivial ] Moderate.
