	•	2. How did you remember where every victim was in the mission space? Just visually mapped it in my head
	•	[Marking Strategy] Used a strategy to remember victim locations? Maybe room numbers. Always oriented yourself to the entrance point
	•	Any things you used in the environment to remember where you had been?

	•	When did that happen? Happened in the middle hallway since it connected to both wings

	•	Did you change your behavior as a result of my warning? Yea I tried speeding up and keeping a mental picture of where I was
