Questions: 

	•	1. Was there any type of strategy you used as you were playing the game? Yea I was trying to save many people while mapping out the area so I can designate which places I’ve cleared. At first I forgot the yellow victim dieing sooner so I modified my strategy to go there first, and then canvassed for remaining. I had a strategy going in but it was flawed based on memory. By the time I revised it, I felt disoriented 
	•	[Prioritization Strategy] (yellow-first)
	•	[Navigation Stratgy] (Wing-by-wing, rm-by-rm, save all as found; Stick to the plan, what made you change your plan, if anything) check main hallway first and then handle each room sequentially and then stranding hallways and then back to the main hallways. 
	•	[Plan Dynamics] Change your plan?
	•	When?
	•	[Deliberate vs vs Opportunistic] Followed a plan or saved victims as soon as you saw them? IF 
	•	2. How did you remember where every victim was in the mission space? If I used the clearing strategy, it didn’t matter. Otherwise it was memory and would search that area
	•	[Marking Strategy] Used a strategy to remember victim locations?
	•	Any things you used in the environment to remember where you had been?
	•	3.  Do you remember any times where you went into a room more than was needed.  Yes numerous times. I went through several rooms many more times than necessary
	•	When did that happen? When I was first disoriented halfway through and then I kept on going through the same rooms. The connecting rooms confused. 
	•	[Efficiency, Use of Attention] How often did you do this? (Not at all, A few times, More than a few times, A lot) 
	•	4. Do you have a vivid mental picture of the map of the building? Main hallway with rooms to the left and right. All the way down. Shape of the hallway
	•	If yes, please describe?
	•	[Mental Mapping] Degree of accurate recollection?
	•	Any rooms you missed?
	•	5. Did you feel any type of pressure as you were completing the mission? (time, confusion, Minecraft controls, frustration, notifications) I want to win/beat the mission. Time pressure and getting the instructions wrong, when I felt disoriented. Once I felt time pressure,my strategy became looser
	•	If so, what type?
	•	When? Around hallway through 
	•	How frequently? 
	•	6. Were there any emotions that you experienced throughout the mission? Frustration and anxiety
	•	[Emotions] If so, what type?
	•	When? Frustration--early on and then anxiety as I realized I was behind the eight ball, then frustration because I accepted I was doing my best
	•	How frequently? 
	•	7. Noticed my warning before yellow box victims expired? I remembered that. It changed my strategy. I was planning to fully clear, but I hadn’t factored in yellows going in first, so I changed 
	•	Thoughts on reminder?
	•	Useful? Yes very useful
	•	Did you change your behavior as a result of my warning?
	•	Earlier, later, just right? Earlier the better even before the mission. Unless they read the instructions close enough to internalize
	•	Evoke any feelings? Frustration for not already knowing that

	•	Glitches & Bugs:
	•	No issues
	•	Suggestions for improvement:
	•	Switches turn on lights, make those clear
	•	Jumping with the spacebar
	•	Map would be helpful
