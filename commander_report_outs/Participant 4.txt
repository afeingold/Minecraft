Questions: 

	•	1. Was there any type of strategy you used as you were playing the game? At first, check all of the rooms. I got sidetracked on the greens because it wasn’t efficient to leave them behind. I switched to saving yellow box victims
	•	[Prioritization Strategy] (yellow-first) When I realized they got critically victims but first wanted to understand the map
	•	[Navigation Stratgy] (Wing-by-wing, rm-by-rm, save all as found; Stick to the plan, what made you change your plan, if anything) Go straight down halls and got sidetracked when rooms connected to the hallways. 
	•	[Plan Dynamics] Change your plan?
	•	When?
	•	[Deliberate vs vs Opportunistic] Followed a plan or saved victims as soon as you saw them? Saved victims as you saw them. 
	•	2. How did you remember where every victim was in the mission space? Three separate hallways. One connext to left, one conenct to right. Some of the rooms connected to the other side I cleared. The other side I left there. 
	•	[Marking Strategy] Used a strategy to remember victim locations?
	•	Any things you used in the environment to remember where you had been? The rooms I could travel between were my sources of reference from where I had been and phsy. Location in the hallways. 
	•	3.  Do you remember any times where you went into a room more than was needed. Yea, in the middle hallway. I overchecked rooms to ensure I missed nobody there. Most of the time I didn’t miss anyone and double checked to be sure. 
	•	When did that happen? Towards last five minutes or so. A bit more anxious about finishing the game on time. 
	•	[Efficiency, Use of Attention] How often did you do this? (Not at all, A few times, More than a few times, A lot)  A few times it was repetitive. But other times I double checked to ensure which rooms I cleared. 
	•	4. Do you have a vivid mental picture of the map of the building? Yes
	•	If yes, please describe? 2 rooms on the right, 2 bathrooms on the left. 3 hallways, right blocked by fire. On the left, 3 rooms last room on the left connected to middle. 4 rooms on each side of central hallway. 2nd room on right connects to right most hallways

	•	5. Did you feel any type of pressure as you were completing the mission? (time, confusion, Minecraft controls, frustration, notifications) Yes
	•	If so, what type? Completing it for fun and to see if I could do it. Time pressure. 
	•	When? In the middle when I had uncertainty about space left and how much of the map I had left. 
	•	How frequently? Not as pressure filled the further I went along. About 5 minutes legft I felt pretty good. 
	•	6. Were there any emotions that you experienced throughout the mission? Slight anxiety, but it was pretty satisfying to finish the game. A bit upset I missed the block and thought there may be rooms I haven’t looked at yet.
